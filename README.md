# Habr

It is my first serious pet project

There i will try to copy functionality of site Habr

--- Technologies that will be used : 

    Spring Boot
    
    Spring MVC
    
    Spring JPA
    
    Spring Security
    
    Thymeleaf + Sec
    
    PostgreSQL as Db
    
    Lombok

--- What make this project diffrent from others?

First of all it's that i didn't copy idea from video where I just copy past some code, it's fully my project

Second, as you see on previous projects i had 1-2 relations in DB  here there are many relationships between tables, which helped me understand Spring JPA properly and also I got experience with Query annotation.


Third, before i often do what i want without kind of plan, but there i change approach that help me most of all. U can see it in todo.txt where i write all my plans for this project

Some notes: Thymeleaf + sec using, new for me and i have plans for that functionality

            First time  i used YML, and think it awesome

--- Project functionality :

    Reg + authorize, update user
    Create posts
    Add tags for post
    open user profile
    Add Privacy for user, u can Hide your information
    Clicking by tag redirect to template where will be all post with them
    Likes,Favorites func
    Adding of comments
    
Maybe it not so much impressive, but it is just start!
